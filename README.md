# Covid-19-Ensemble-Kalman-Filter

The associated code for my reading course on Industrial Mathematics. In this experimentnt I use the Ensemble Kalman Filter and the SIRD model to forecast the covid cases in the UK between June 1st 2021 and July 31st 2021. 

To run this code, download and run the main script.
